| October 9  |  1:15-1:45pm  |                     Stevie and I worked on a first attempt that solved for the number of appearances of the String and not the highest length of consecutive STRs. Because of this our solution was off. Solving it now to try and redo our thinking (post-hint). |
| October 11 | 10:55-11:55am | I worked on a new attempt that set a value to the string based on a value I set for each ATCG. I then compared it, got the next value to compare, and continued, storing the STR lengths in an ArrayList. It didn't really work. I'll keep trying new strategies. |
