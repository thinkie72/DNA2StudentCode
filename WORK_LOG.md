Because of this our solution was off. Solving it now to try and redo our thinking (post-hint). |

I then compared it, got the next value to compare, and continued, storing the STR lengths in an ArrayList. It didn't really work. I'll keep trying new strategies. |

During this long stretch, I trial-and-error-ed a bunch of other strategies, all of which failed and made less sense than this attempt. Overall, I'm pretty happy with my understanding of how this one should work, but the code just isn't working after I continually debug, print, etc. I'm really stuck. I'm excited to see what I can learn in the coming days... |

I think it mostly works but I am still getting index out of bounds errors that I need to fix. I'll continue working soon to fix them but I think I have a good foundation. |

It didn't really work so I'm going to try to improve that more. I feel like I'm close, cause I fixed my indexOutOfBounds errors, but I'm now getting all outputs of zeroes, so I'll try to fix that. |
| October 23 |   10:30-1am   | Looking really bad. I couldn't get my previous code to work, so I re-solved it but again couldn't find a way to implement the constant time rehashing method without the program only outputting 0. I consulted with both the sheet we discussed during our meeting and the slides to see if I was missing everything, and I think I've exhausted all my options. at this point, I'm going to just call it a night. I'll come see you in the morning and hopefully we can troubleshoot one of these versions. The thing I'm most confused about is my logic seems to make sense but I just can't away from the outputs of 0. Hopefully we can figure this out. This version here is the most advanced version I could get to pass all tests. |
