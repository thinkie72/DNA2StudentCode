| October 9  |  1:15-1:45pm  |                                                                                                                                            Stevie and I worked on a first attempt that solved for the number of appearances of the String and not the highest length of consecutive STRs. Because of this our solution was off. Solving it now to try and redo our thinking (post-hint). |
| October 11 | 10:55-11:55am |                                                                                                                        I worked on a new attempt that set a value to the string based on a value I set for each ATCG. I then compared it, got the next value to compare, and continued, storing the STR lengths in an ArrayList. It didn't really work. I'll keep trying new strategies. |
| October 14 |   9:30-11pm   | Not looking good. During this long stretch, I trial-and-error-ed a bunch of other strategies, all of which failed and made less sense than this attempt. Overall, I'm pretty happy with my understanding of how this one should work, but the code just isn't working after I continually debug, print, etc. I'm really stuck. I'm excited to see what I can learn in the coming days... |
